    <p>Advancement in technology has also become prevalent in the dating industry. In today's world
      people are less likely to go to a local bar or meet people in the traditional way. Majority
      of the people will be found using apps like Tinder, Bumble and other common dating apps.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to some market reseach done by the Chance It team, we found that Tinder has about 25 million
      users while Bumble has about 7 million users. So what is it that makes all of these apps so unique?
      <pre></pre>
      The differences between dating apps usually are found in the way they work and designed. Let's take Bumble for
      an example. The way Bumble works is that the women initiate the contact. On the other hand, Tinder
      is extremely popular because of the user-friendly interface and functionality.
      <pre></pre>
      Although these apps have their differences, they all boil down to one concept: <b>Superficiality</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chance It was born from the motivation of reducing superficiality. Eliminating it would be quite a stretch,
      but reducing it was our main objective. Chance It is a dating app that will allow users to initially match
      based on voice. Record your voice on your profile and then when matching others, get a snippet of their
      personality based on their description and their voice.
    </p>

    <p>
      A simple use case scenario along with screenshots of the app is shown below.
