    <h1><center>Predictive Data Analytics</center></h1>
    <p> Machine Failure prediction is a concept that is catching the eyes of many different
      companies. The benefits of predictive analytics in machine health management are numerous.
      As an example, if a company working with engines were to use predictive analytics, they would
      be able to save on the money that they spend in terms of labor and equipment. Knowing when a
      machine is going to fail can help the company plan ahead as to when the machine should be replaced
      or if there is a component of the machine that should be replaced rather than the whole machine being
      replaced. In addition, implementing predictive analytics to machine health management helps improve strategic
      planning because companies will be able to increase revenue, increase the efficienct of employee time among
      many other benefits.

      For this project, the dataset that was used was the <a href="https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/groups/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/">Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation Dataset</a>
      available through NASA. The authors used the C-MAPSS tool coded in MATLAB and Simulink to simulate a
      large commercial turbofan engine at different flight conditions and power modes to generate different
      sets of trainig and testing data.

      The objective of this project was to use different clustering and classification algorithms to identify the
      onset of the machines. Some algothims that were used include: Kohonen Nets, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees,
      and Random Forest. In addition, Dimensionality Reduction was used in order to improve the accuracy of the results.
