    <h1><center>Visual Data Analytics</center></h1>
    <p>
      With the advancement of technology across all industries and with the introduction
      of multiple mediums of gathering data it has become extremely crucial to sort the
      meaningful data from the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When looking at the healthcare industry, another motivation for capturing the meaningful
      data is a physician's time. With the amount of data that is being captured, whether it be
      through wearable devices or through Electronic Health Records (EHRs), a physician does not
      have time to look through the amount of data available, keep up with new research being done,
      and meet with his/her patients.
    </p>
    <p>
       Keeping this motivation in mind, I was introduced to a problem faced by a few Gastroenterologists
       from Mayo Clinic in which they were spending hours analyzing Colonoscopy videos when in reality
       they were only interested in some data starting from the Withdrawal Phase (WP) of the Colonoscopy.
       In addition, it was found that even during the WP, there were only a few frames that the Gasteroenterologists
       were interested in analyzing. This problem introduced the idea of "Effective" withdrawal time.

     </p>
     <p>
       While collaborating with the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and the Department of
       Biomedical Informatics at Arizona State University, I was able to develop an algorithm for
       extracting frames from colonoscopy videos so that the physicians can analyze groups of frames rather
       than watching hours and hours of complete colonoscopies. This algorithm was developed using MATLAB.
    </p>
    <p>
      This research was presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Gasteroenterology (ACG) in
      October, 2016 and led to a publication and won an accolade of Presidential Poster Award.
